## Prerequisites

In order to develop for GrÃ¼vee you are going to need to have a few things installed on your machine:

1. **Javascript**

    - [Node.js 12.9.1](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.9.1/)

2. **iOS Development**

    - [Latest Version of Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
    - [Latest Version of CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

3. **Android Development**

    - [JDK 11 or Lower](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (This is very important)
    - [Latest Version of Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
    - [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)
    - Android Build Tools 28.0.3 (Installable from Studio SDK Manager)
    - Android 9 SDK (Installable from Studio SDK Manager)

## TODO - Add setup for .env file

## TODO - Add setup for integrating gruveebackend repo

## TODO - Add setup for running Android emulator

    - `emulator -avd Pixel_2_API_29`

# Running GrÃ¼vee Locally

Now we are at the GOOD stuff. Time to get GrÃ¼vee running locally. Make sure you have the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) installed. Open up **two instances** of your favorite terminal/command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the GrÃ¼vee repository for both of them. One is going to run your React Native bundle server and the other will start the GrÃ¼vee iOS or Android app.

## NPM Commands

All the NPM commands and dependencies for this project can be located in the [package.json file](/package.json), but we only need two to get started.

1. This npm command will download all the React Native package

    (this is only needed when cloned for the first time or if new npm packages are introduced to the [package.json file](/package.json))

    ```command
    $ npm install
    ```

2. This npm command will start the React Native bundle server
    ```command
    $ npm start
    ```

## ðŸ“± GrÃ¼vee iOS Development

If you are running GrÃ¼vee for iOS use the following commands.

> **Please note that the npm command utilizes an iPhone 11 Simulator**.
>
> If you do not have this installed, you will need install it or go into the [package.json file](/package.json) and replace the `ios-start` script with the following:
>
> ```js
> "ios-start": "react-native run-ios --simulator=\"{WhateveriPhoneModelYouAreUsing}\",
> ```

Once thats complete run the following commands:

1. Install cocoapods:

    ```console
    $ cd ios/ && pod install
    ```

2. Run iOS emulator

    Ensure you're in the project's root directory

    ```console
    $ npm run ios-start
    ```

## ðŸ¤– GrÃ¼vee Android Development

> **Please note that you need to start the emulator from Android Studio first before you run any commands.**
>
> For this just open up Android Studio and build the project, with an emulator set.
>
> To note: we have been developing on a Pixel 2 emulator and a Pixel 3 physical device, but feel free to use any device you'd like! At the end of the day it will be better for testing anyways.

### Setup keystore for android signing

Where `$GRUVEE_PROJECT` is the location of your root project.

```bash
$ cd $GRUVEE_PROJECT/android/app
$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Add the keystore password (min 6 characters). Fill the information it requires (name, organization, country, etc), finally add the debug key password (you may use the same password as for the keystore, for development purposes).

Next we open the gradle build config (located at `android/app/build.gradle`) and under `signingConfigs` update the `storePassword` and `keyPassword`. (**Note**: if you changed the store filename (`-keystore`) and alias (`-alias`) you will have to update that in the `build.gradle` file).

```gradle
signingConfigs {
    debug {
        storeFile file('debug.keystore')
        storePassword '<your-keystore-password-here>'
        keyAlias 'androiddebugkey'
        keyPassword '<your-keystore-password-here>'
    }
}
```

### Run the dev server

Run `npm run start` FIRST on one terminal and then `npm run android-start` on another one.

```bash
$ npm run start # On a different terminal
$ npm run android-start
```

Congratulations! You should now see a beautiful GrÃ¼vee mobile app displayed and ready to go!
